# Research on Keyboard Layouts

Objective: Study the efficency of a keyboard layouts and the parameters that make a good keyboard layout

Goal: Create an genetic algorithm that can determine the best (and worst) keyboard layouts

  - What are the things that make up a keyboard?
    A keyboard layout is characterized by the way each letter is positioned relative to the other keys. Some arrangements are better than others typically my putting the most commonly typed letters on the home row of the keyboard.
  - How to make a keyboard better?
    There are many factors that make a keboard 'better' and ultimately that is a subjective measure. I want to find a good way to objectively test how to make a keyboard layout efficiency and even practicality in the real world.
  - Parameters for a optimal keyboard layout
    The optimimal keyboard layout will have all of the most commonly typed letters somewhere easy to reach. That is the core characteristic behind if a certain layout is better than another but there are also some smaller details that can impact the typing experience. For example, someone typing normal english will want a different layout than a programmer who writes a lot of code for a living. You can also take into account common letter doubles like 'th' or 'ch' and make them roll inward on the keyboard. The human hand wants to roll keypresses from the pinkys inward to the index fingers. This will make the typing experience much more enjoyable and smooth. Another thing to keep track of is the actual physical keyboard itself. A normal keyboard has all of the keys staggered in such a way that works but is not entirely natural. Its natural for the right hand but really unnatural for the left if you look at the way that the staggering works. The best alternative is to use an ortholinear keyboard where all of the keys are straight up and down. This is much more natural than the normal keyboard stagger but there is even more to improve. You can go further to split the keyboard in half for each hand, curve the physical keyboard to account for each finger length, and add more buttons to the thumb. It turns out that the thumb is pretty dexerious, at least more than the pinky, and can be used to type a bunch of letters at once. Physical keyboards can also have a glove type build where the keys are curved upwards to make the keys on the keyboard easies to reasch such as the Fkeys.
