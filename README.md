# Joshua Markle's Independent Research Project

This project contains research that I will conduct as a part of GSST's senior research course.

## Reading the research

Open the pdf <a href="https://joshuamarkle.github.io/research-project/research.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

- The .pdf file in this project is what contains all of my up-to-date research neatly layed out.
- The .md file contains the code that I wrote in order to compile the pdf in LaTeX.

## Viewing progress

All progress can be viewed through commits. Each commit contains

- A message summarizing changes made
- Viewable changes to the .pdf (and .tex) file

Clicking on the commit button will take you to the commit history.

## Notes for me

Compile the `.md` file with `pandoc research.md --output=research.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex`
